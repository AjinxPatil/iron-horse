2.0.0 Alpha 16 Release
----------------------

Iron Horse 2.

It ain't done but it's kind of fun.

Stick to 1935-2050.  Trains introduced before 1935 may have unfinished sprites.

Designed to be used with 'vehicles expire' set to to 'on', Horse 2 has a *lot* of vehicles and crowds the buy menu unless expiry is used.

*Release Notes, for the Reading of*

- use with Termite railtype grf to get Metro and Narrow Gauge trains
- extensive cargo sprite support, but some cargo sprites are known to be missing
- no savegame compatibility with Iron Horse 1
- can be used _alongside_ Iron Horse 1, if you must (kind of odd, but eh)
