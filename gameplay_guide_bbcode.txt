Drafting a gameplay guide, early days, but eh.  Clarifications?

[b][size=150]Gameplay Guide - Iron Pony[/size][/b]

"The main thing is that in Iron Horse you can still have a good game by just picking the train that you think looks nice".

For those who want more, Iron Horse has a fully developed tech tree, with multiple different railtypes and engine roles.
It's best explored by diving in and just playing, but this gameplay guide provides a brief outline of the tech tree and the vehicle types.

[b]General Purpose / Express Engines[/b]
    [list]
    [*] passengers, mail and valuables
    [*] high-priority freight cargos like food and engineering supplies, which can be carried in high-speed mail cars and express cars
    [*] general freight, but if a dedicated freight engine is available with similar power, the freight engine will generally be lower cost, and higher performance
    [/list]
[b]Freight Engines[/b]
    [list]
    [*] all general freight except cargos like food and engineering supplies, which can be carried in high-speed mail cars and express cars, which freight engines can't haul at maximum speed
    [/list]
[b]Railcars / Multiple-Unit Trains[/b]
    [list]
    [*] these run at the speed of freight trains, and are suited to
        [list]
        [*] short routes
        [*] routes which are heavily used by freight trains, which limit the maximum speed of other trains on the route
        [/list]
    [*] railcars can generally haul one additional unpowered coach, mail car or other wagon, on level routes
    [*] railcars can be combined as needed
    [/list]
[b]High Speed Trains[/b]
    [list]
    [*] high speed diesel passenger engines with dedicated high-speed coaches
    [*] can attach other types of cars to haul mail or freight cargos but will travel at less than maximum engine speed
    [/list]
[b]Very High Speed Trains[/b]
    [list]
    [*] TGV-style electric passenger trains with very high speeds
    [*] power is distributed throughout the train
        [list]
        [*] engines are relatively low power
        [*] every set of coaches attached to the engine adds more power
        [/list]
    [*] tilt bonus for higher speed through curves
    [*] attaching other types of cars is not recommended, the train will be very underpowered and will travel at much less than maximum engine speed
    [/list]
[b]Metro Trains[/b]
    [list]
    [*] pax, mail, valuables, food and similar town cargos
    [*] for very busy routes in and around large cities
        [list]
        [*] metro trains have very high capacity and relatively high run costs
        [*] cargo will age quickly due to crowding
        [*] to be profitable, metro needs to be used on routes with short distances between stations, and very high loadings
        [/list]
    [*] can be used in stations  as small as 1 tile
    [*] metro trains can be combined as needed
    [/list]
[b]Narrow Gauge Trains[/b]
    [list]
    [*] low power trains with low buy and run costs, and relatively low speeds
    [*] effective for short routes
    [*] can be quite effective on long routes
    [*] one general purpose engine per generation, combine them as needed for more power
    [*] narrow gauge railcars available later in the game
        [list]
        [*] same speed as general purpose engine
        [*] can generally haul one additional unpowered coach, mail car or other wagon, on level routes
        [*] narrow gauge railcars can be combined as needed
        [/list]
    [/list]
[b]Electric vs. Steam / Diesel[/b]
    [list]
    [*] electric engines generally cost more to buy, and less to run than similar steam / diesel equivalents
    [/list]
[b]Electro-Diesels[/b]
    [list]
    [*] go-anywhere-do-anything engines that work on both diesel and electric power
    [*] power on electric will generally be much higher than power on diesel
    [*] for routes with a mix of electrified and non-electrified rails
    [/list]
[b]Brake Vans[/b]
    [list]
    [*] just for eye candy on freight trains, no gameplay effect
    [/list]
[b]Passenger Coaches vs. Luxury Passenger Coaches[/b]
    [list]
    [*] on long routes (64 tiles or more) luxury passenger coaches will benefit from a better cargo payment rate compared to ordinary coaches
    [*] on shorter routes there is little difference
    [/list]
[b]Livery Tricks[/b]
    [list]
    [*] All engines and coaches use both company colours
    [*] Some wagons use both company colours
    [*] Some vehicles have alternative liveries available, including all coaches and railcars, and some wagons
    [list]
        [*] Alternative liveries are either random, or engine specific, or cargo specific
        [*] Some liveries can be selected by the player by flipping (ctrl-click) the vehicle in depot
    [/list]
    [/list]
